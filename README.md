**Note:** This is abandoned. Code is left up for prosperity but it's not available on the Mozilla Add-ons site anymore.

## About
This extension was created as an informal fork of [hide-youtube-shorts](https://github.com/Vulpelo/hide-youtube-shorts/) by [Vulpelo](https://github.com/Vulpelo). However, instead of hiding shorts site-wide, it adds a toggle to hide Shorts and regular Videos on the Subscription page only.

**Toggle Only Mode:** This setting does not allow Shorts and Videos to display at the same time. Effectively creating two seperate feeds for your Subscriptions.

## Built With

HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript. :)
