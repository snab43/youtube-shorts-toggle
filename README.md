## Getting Started

You can install the add-on for Mozilla Firefox on the [Firefox Add-on page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-subscription-toggle/). Google Chrome is currently not supported.

## About
This extension was created as an informal fork of [hide-youtube-shorts](https://github.com/Vulpelo/hide-youtube-shorts/) by [Vulpelo](https://github.com/Vulpelo). However, instead of hiding shorts site-wide, it adds a toggle to hide Shorts and regular Videos on the Subscription page only.

## Built With

HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript. :)

## Roadmap

- [X] Initial commit
- [X] Basic functionality
- [ ] Clean up code
- [ ] Remember toggle status in local storage
- [X] Publish on Firefox's Add-ons page
- [ ] Google Chrome compatibility
