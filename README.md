    <h3 align="center">YouTube Shorts Toggle</h3>

    <p align="center">
        A Firefox add-on that adds a toggle for YouTube Shorts content on the Subscription page.
    </p>

## About
This extension was created as an informal fork of [hide-youtube-shorts](https://github.com/Vulpelo/hide-youtube-shorts/) by [Vulpelo](https://github.com/Vulpelo). However, instead of hiding shorts site-wide, it adds a toggle to hide Shorts on the Subscription page only. It also includes functionality to hide regular Videos, too.
